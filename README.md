# NxbRepas - A turn management App

## Introduction

Turn management for the *rep√°s* which will allow to create turns, and let people to join them.
Will be also possible to list turns and users.
Users will be able to join to the turns by theirselves if there are gaps, but teachers would be also allowed to move pupils between turns in order to organize them, if it is needed.

So if a pupil is moved by the teacher to another turn he or she will recieve a notification. (Not decided yet if it will be as push notification or another via (Whatsapp or Telegram)

To sum up, the final goal of the app is allow teachers to create turns, and let users to sign up.
